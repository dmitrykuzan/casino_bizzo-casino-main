    <p class="about__subtitle">
      Self-exclusion means asking the casino to exclude you from gambling with them for a certain period of time. As a licensed website, Bizzo Casino provides all clients with this option, allowing them to self-exclude to prevent further betting on casino games. They can also give you contacts of helplines that offer confidential advice and counseling.

      <h4 class="about__list-title">This is how self-exclusion works: </h4>
      <ul class="about__list">
        <li>You will be excluded for an agreed period of time.</li>
        <li>You will be removed from email lists.</li>
        <li>
          You should wait until the self-exclusion period expires to gamble on the website again.
